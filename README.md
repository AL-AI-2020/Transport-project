# **Project name: Solving transportation problems using machine learning.**

## **The main goal of the project**:
Predict the number of passengers from one place to another during rush hour in the mornings during the week (days from Sunday to Thursday).

## **Target variable**
 Target variable -  the number of passengers traveling from one place to another (from zone A to the zone B) during the morning rush hour from 6:00-9:00 (Morning_rush_6_9).

## **Data used for the project**:
The project used Israeli data to implement machine learning models, which are publicly available on the website of the government: https://data.gov.il/

1. The Survey of traveling passengers by hour and from each zone to each zone in Israel: https://data.gov.il/dataset/tripscelular_1819
2. Statistical data and geodata for each zone in Israel: https://data.gov.il/dataset/tripscelular_1819
3. Motorate data - number of cars per 1000 inhabitants in each zone: https://data.gov.il/dataset/taz_mot_rate_2040  
4. Data and geodata of all industrial zones in Israel: https://data.gov.il/dataset/industrial
5. Job density data for each zone in Israel: https://data.gov.il/dataset/2030
6. Location data for fast train stops: https://data.gov.il/dataset/lrt_stat
7. Location data for bus lines with a large number of passengers: https://data.gov.il/dataset/tma_23a4_lines
